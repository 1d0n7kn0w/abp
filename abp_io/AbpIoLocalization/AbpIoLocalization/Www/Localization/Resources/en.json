It has facilitated my transition from an aspiring developer to a confident professional ready to make a mark in the software world. I am looking forward to the exciting projects that await me, knowing that ABP will be there to guide me. It is more than just a product; it's a partner in success.",

Even if you are not going to use framework itself, you can develop yourself with docs.abp.io which is well and professionally prepared. (OpenIddict, Redis, Quartz etc.)\nBecause many thing pre-built, it shortens project development time significantly. (Such as login page, exception handling, data filtering-seeding, audit logging, localization, auto api controller etc.)\nAs an example from our app, i have used Local Event Bus for stock control. So, I am able to manage order movements by writing stock handler.\nIt is wonderful not to lose time for CreationTime, CreatorId. They are filled automatically.",
