# Unifying the ABP.IO Platform

I am very excited to announce that some big changes and improvements are coming to the ABP.IO Platform soon. In this post, I will explain the changes we are currently working on. Let's start...

## Merging the ABP.IO Websites

ABP.IO website has many subdomains currently:

* **abp.io**: Home page of the open source ABP Framework project.
* **community.abp.io**: A website that community can share contents and we organize events.
* **commercial.abp.io**: A website to promote and sell commercial ABP licenses which have pre-built modules, themes, tooling and support on top of the ABP Framework.
* **docs.abp.io**: The technical documentation of the ABP Framework and ABP Commercial.
* **blog.abp.io**: A blog website to announce the news on the platform.
* **support.abp.io**: Premium support for the ABP Commercial customers.

All these subdomains (except the support website for now) are being merged to the abp.io domain. All their contents and UI designs are being revised and enriched.

Some fundamental purposes of that change are;

* Making content more coherent and holistic,
* Making the design more harmonious,
* Making the contents of the old subdomains more visible and reachable,
* Allow you to navigate through the web pages much easier,
* Reducing duplications between different websites,

### The Mega Menu

As I said above, the abp.io UI design is also being revised. One of the big revisions is the main menu. We are replacing the current main navigation by a mega menu as shown in the following figure:

We believe that new mega menu will allow you to navigate through the web pages much easier.
