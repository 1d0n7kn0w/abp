# ABP Commercial 4.3 RC Has Been Published

ABP Commercial version 4.3 RC (Release Candidate) has been published alongside ABP Framework 4.3. RC (TODO: link). I will introduce the new features in this blog post. Here, a list of highlights for this release;

* The **microservice starter template** is getting more mature. We've also added a **service template** to easily add new microservices to the solution.
* New option for the application starter template to have a **separate database schema for tenant databases**.
* New **Forms** module to create surveys
* **Enable/disable modules** per edition/tenant.
* **Lepton theme** and **Account module**'s source codes are available with the Team License too.

Here, some other features already covered in the ABP Framework announcement, but worth to mention here since they are also implemented for the ABP Commercial;

* **Blazor UI server-side** support

* **Email setting** management UI
* **Module extensibility** system is now available for the **Blazor UI** too.

> This post doesn't cover the features and changes done on the ABP Framework side. Please also see the **ABP Framework 4.3. RC blog post** (TODO: link).

## The Migration Guide

**This upgrade requires some manual work documented in [the migration guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/4.3/migration-guides/v4_3).** Please read the guide carefully. Even if your application doesn't break on upgrade, you should apply the changes to not have problems with the future releases.
