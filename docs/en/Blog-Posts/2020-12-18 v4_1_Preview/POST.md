## About the Next Release(s)

Beginning from the next version (4.2.0), we are starting to spend more effort on the CMS Kit module. The purpose of this module is to provide CMS primitives (e.g. comments, tags, reactions, contents...) and features (e.g. blog, pages, surveys) as pre-built and reusable components. Current blog module will be a part of the CMS Kit module. We will continue to prepare documents, guides, tutorials and examples. And surely, we will continue to make enhancements and optimizations on the current features.

The planned preview release date for the version 4.2.0 is January 14, 2021 and the final (stable) version release date is January 28, 2021.

Follow the [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestones) for all the planned ABP Framework version release dates.
