You can use any IDE that supports .NET 8.x, like [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Migration Guides

There are a few breaking changes in this version that may affect your application.
Please see the following migration documents, if you are upgrading from v8.x or earlier:

* [ABP Framework 8.0 to 8.1 Migration Guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/8.1/Migration-Guides/Abp-8_1)

## What's New with ABP Framework 8.1?

In this section, I will introduce some major features released in this version.
Here is a brief list of titles explained in the next sections:

* Introducing the `ExposeKeyedServiceAttribute`
* Custom Menu Component Support for MVC UI
* Introducing the `DisableAbpFeaturesAttribute`

### Introducing the `ExposeKeyedServiceAttribute`

[Keyed dependency injection (DI) services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0#keyed-services) were added to the built-in DI container as a new feature with .NET 8.0. This is an important feature, which allows for registering and retrieving DI services using keys/names.

In this version, we have introduced the `ExposeKeyedServiceAttribute` to allow you to automatically register keyed services by conventions.

**Example:**

```csharp
[ExposeKeyedService<ITaxCalculator>("taxCalculator")]
[ExposeKeyedService<ICalculator>("calculator")]
public class TaxCalculator: ICalculator, ITaxCalculator, ICanCalculate, ITransientDependency
{
}
```

In the example above, the `TaxCalculator` class exposes the `ITaxCalculator` interface with the key `taxCalculator` and the `ICalculator` interface with the key `calculator`. 

Thanks to that, you can use the [`FromKeyedServicesAttribute`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.fromkeyedservicesattribute?view=dotnet-plat-ext-8.0) to resolve a certain keyed service in the constructor:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    //...
    public MyClass([FromKeyedServices("taxCalculator")] ITaxCalculator taxCalculator)
    {
        TaxCalculator = taxCalculator;
    }
}
```

> Notice that the `ExposeKeyedServiceAttribute` only exposes the keyed services. So, you can not inject the `ITaxCalculator` or `ICalculator` interfaces in your application without using the `FromKeyedServicesAttribute` as shown in the example above.

> If you want to learn more about the keyed dependency injection services, please refer to the [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0#keyed-services) and [ABP Framework's Dependency Injection document](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/8.1/Dependency-Injection#exposekeyedservice-attribute).

### Custom Menu Component Support for MVC UI

In this version, we have introduced the **custom menu component support**, which allows you to use a custom component for a certain menu item.

You can use the `UseComponent` extension method while defining menu items to use your custom component for the related menu item:

```csharp
context.Menu.Items.Add(
  new ApplicationMenuItem("Custom.1", "My Custom Menu", "#")
    .UseComponent(typeof(MyMenuComponent)));
```

Then, for the related menu item, your custom component will be rendered on the UI.

### Introducing the `DisableAbpFeaturesAttribute`

In this version, we have introduced the `DisableAbpFeaturesAttribute` to allow you to disable interceptors, middlewares, and MVC filters for a specific controller.

For example, you may want to disable interceptors for a certain controller, but you may also don't want to disable middlewares and mvc filters, in that case, you can use the `DisableAbpFeaturesAttribute` as follows:

```csharp
[Route("api/my-endpoint")]
[DisableAbpFeatures(DisableInterceptors = true, DisableMiddleware = false, DisableMvcFilters = false)]
public class MyController : AbpController
{

}
```

This can be useful if you have some APIs that are used frequently but you don't need all the features of ABP Framework.

> **Note:** If you want to disable all interceptors, middlewares, and filters for a certain controller, then you can use the `[DisableAbpFeatures]` without the need to specify the parameters, they are disabled by default.

## What's New with ABP Commercial 8.1?

We've also worked on ABP Commercial to align the features and changes made in the ABP Framework. The following sections introduce a few new features coming with ABP Commercial 8.1.

Core team members of the ABP Framework, [Halil Ibrahim Kalkan](https://twitter.com/hibrahimkalkan), [Alper Ebicoglu](https://twitter.com/alperebicoglu), [Engincan Veske](https://twitter.com/EngincanVeske), and [Bige Be≈üikci Yaman](https://twitter.com/bigedediki) attended [NDC London 2024](https://ndclondon.com/) from the 31st of January to the 2nd of February.  

It was the 5th time in a row we were a proud sponsor of NDC London. It, now, basically feels like home spending 3 days in Queen Elizabeth Centre II with NDC London for the [ABP.IO](https://abp.io/) team to be there.

These 3 days with the team was all about chatting and having fun with amazing attendees and speakers. We met with talented and passionate software developers and introduced the [open source ABP Framework](https://github.com/abpframework/abp) - web application framework built on ASP.NET Core and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) - the complete web application development platform built on open source ABP Framework - to them.

> We shared our insights and key highlights from the NDC London 2024 event, which you can find at [https://blog.abp.io/abp/NDC-London-2024-ABP.IO-Key-Highlights](https://blog.abp.io/abp/NDC-London-2024-ABP.IO-Key-Highlights).
