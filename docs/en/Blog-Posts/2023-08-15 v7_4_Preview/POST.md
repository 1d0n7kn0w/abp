1) **Upgrade** the ABP CLI to version `7.4.0-rc.1` using a command line terminal:

````bash
dotnet tool update Volo.Abp.Cli -g --version 7.4.0-rc.1
````

**or install** it if you haven't before:

````bash
dotnet tool install Volo.Abp.Cli -g --version 7.4.0-rc.1

## What's New with ABP Framework 7.4?

In this section, I will introduce some major features released in this version. Here is a brief list of the titles that will be explained in the next sections:

* Dynamic Setting Store
* Introducing the `AdditionalAssemblyAttribute`
* `CorrelationId` Support on Distributed Events
* Dynamic Database Migrations
* Other News

### Dynamic Setting Store

Prior to this version, it was hard to define settings in different microservices and centrally manage all setting definitions in a single admin application. To make that possible, we were adding project references for all the microservices' service contract packages from a single microservice, so it can know all the setting definitions and manage them. 

In this version, ABP Framework introduces the Dynamic Setting Store, which is an important feature that allows you to collect and get all setting definitions from a single point and overcome the setting management problems on microservices.

> *Note*: If you are upgrading from an earlier version and using the Setting Management module, you need to create a new migration and apply it to your database because a new database table has been added for this feature.

### Introducing the `AdditionalAssemblyAttribute`

In this version, we have introduced the `AdditionalAssemblyAttribute` to define additional assemblies to be part of a module. ABP Framework automatically registers all the services of your module to the [Dependency Injection System](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Dependency-Injection). It finds the service types by scanning types in the assembly that defines your module class. Typically, every assembly contains a separate module class definition and modules are depend on each other using the `DependsOn` attribute.

In some rare cases, your module may consist of multiple assemblies, and only one of them define a module class, and you want to make the other assemblies parts of your module. This is especially useful, if you dont't want to depend on that module's dependencies.

In that case, you can use the `AdditionalAssembly` attribute as shown below:

```csharp
[DependsOn(...)] // Your module dependencies as you normally would do
[AdditionalAssembly(typeof(IdentityServiceModule))] // A type in the target assembly (in another assembly)
public class IdentityServiceTestModule : AbpModule
{
    ...
}
```

With the `AdditonalAssembly` attribute definition, ABP loads the assembly containing the `IdentityServiceModule` class as a part of the blog module. Notice that, in this case, none of the module dependencies of the `IdentityServiceModule` are loaded. Because, we are not depending on the `IdentityServiceModule`, instead we are just adding its assembly as a part of the `IdentityServiceTestModule`.

> You can check the [Module Development Basics](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/7.4/Module-Development-Basics) documentation to learn more.

### `CorrelationId` Support on Distributed Events

In this version, `CorrelationId` (a unique key that is used in distributed applications to trace requests accross multiple services/operations) is being attached to the distributed events, so you can relate events with HTTP requests and can trace all the related activities.

ABP Framework generates a `correlationId` for the first time when an operation is started and then attachs the current `correlationId` to distributed events as an additional property. For example, if you are using the [transactional outbox or inbox pattern provided by ABP Framework](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Distributed-Event-Bus#outbox-inbox-for-transactional-events), you can see the `correlationId` in the extra properties of the `IncomingEventInfo` or `OutgoingEventInfo` classes with the standard `X-Correlation-Id` key.

### Dynamic Database Migrations

### Other News

* [OpenIddict](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core/tree/4.7.0) library has been upgraded to **v4.7.0**. See [#17334](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/17334) for more info.
* ABP v7.4 introduces the `Volo.Abp.Maui.Client` package, which is used by the MAUI mobile application in ABP Commercial. See [#17201](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/17201) for more info.
* In this version, the `AbpAspNetCoreIntegratedTestBase` class gets a generic type parameter, which expect either a startup class or an ABP module class. This allows us to use configurations from an ABP module or old-style ASP.NET Core Startup class in a test application class and this simplifies the test application project. See [#17039](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/17039) for more info.

## What's New with ABP Commercial 7.4?

We've also worked on [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) to align the features and changes made in the ABP Framework. The following sections introduce new features coming with ABP Commercial 7.4.
