# ABP Platform 9.0 Has Been Released Based on .NET 9.0

![](cover-image.png)

Today, we are happy to release the [ABP](https://abp.io/) version **9.0 RC** (Release Candidate). This blog post introduces the new features and important changes in this new version.

Try this version and provide feedback for a more stable version of ABP v9.0! Thanks to all of you.

## Get Started with the 9.0 RC

You can check the [Get Started page](https://abp.io/get-started) to see how to get started with ABP. You can either download [ABP Studio](https://abp.io/get-started#abp-studio-tab) (**recommended**, if you prefer a user-friendly GUI application - desktop application) or use the [ABP CLI](https://abp.io/docs/latest/cli).

By default, ABP Studio uses stable versions to create solutions. Therefore, if you want to create a solution with a preview version, first you need to create a solution and then switch your solution to the preview version from the ABP Studio UI:

## Migration Guide

There are a few breaking changes in this version that may affect your application. Please read the migration guide carefully, if you are upgrading from v8.x: [ABP Version 9.0 Migration Guide](https://abp.io/docs/9.0/release-info/migration-guides/abp-9-0)

## What's New with ABP v9.0?

In this section, I will introduce some major features released in this version.
Here is a brief list of titles explained in the next sections:

* Upgraded to .NET 9.0
* Introducing the **Extension Property Policy**
* Allow wildcards for Redirect Allowed URLs
* Docs Module: Show larger images on the same page
* Google Cloud Storage BLOB Provider
* Removed React Native mobile option from free templates
* Suite: Better naming for multiple navigation properties to same entity
* CMS Kit Pro: Feedback feature improvements

### Upgraded to .NET 9.0

We've upgraded ABP to .NET 9.0, so you need to move your solutions to .NET 9.0 if you want to use ABP 9.0. You can check [Microsoftâ€™s Migrate from ASP.NET Core 8.0 to 9.0 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/80-90), to see how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 8.0 project to ASP.NET Core 9.0.

> **Note:** Since the stable version of .NET 9 hasn't released yet, we upgraded ABP to .NET v9.0-rc.2. We will update the entire ABP Platform to .NET 9 stable, after Microsoft releases it on November 13-14 with the stable ABP 9.0 release.
