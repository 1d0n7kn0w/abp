# Solution Templates: A Guide to Select the Right One For You

ABP provides several [startup templates](index.md) to you. It is important to start with the right startup template that is suitable for your project and team. This guide aims to lead you to select the most proper startup template for your requirements.

## What is a Startup Template?

Before going further, it is important to understand what is a startup solution template and what it provides for you.

### Pre-Architected Solution Structure

A startup solution template is a pre-architected structure for a purpose. For example, the [layered startup template](layered-web-application/index.md) is a great starting point if you want to build a layered application codebase based on [Domain-Driven Design](../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/index.md) principles and patterns.

However, starting with any startup template don't limit you. After creating the solution, you can add or remove projects, layers, integration packages, or even create other applications and services in the solution to build a microservice solution. However, if your purpose is to build a microservice solution, it is best to start with the [microservice startup template](microservice/index.md).

So, it is best to start with the most suitable startup template for your purpose and then modify the solution to fit your requirements.

### Well-Structured

Beside the overall solution structure, internals of each project in a solution template is well-structured. It is clear where will you place your [entities](../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/entities.md), [repositories](../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/repositories.md), [data access code](../framework/data/index.md), [application services](../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/application-services.md), [API controllers](../framework/api-development/index.md), [UI elements](../framework/ui/index.md) and so on...
