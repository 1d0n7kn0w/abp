# ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages: Auto-Complete Select
A simple select component sometimes isn't useful with huge amount of data. ABP Provides a select implementation that works with pagination and server-side search via using [Select2](https://select2.org/). It works with single or multiple choices well.

A screenshot can be shown below.

## Getting Started

This is a core feature and it's used by ABP Framework. There is no custom installation or additional package required.

## Usage

A simple is usage is presented below. The select must have `auto-complete-select` class and following attributes:

- `data-autocomplete-api-url`: * API Endpoint url to get select items. **GET** request will be sent to this url.
- `data-autocomplete-display-property`: * Property name to display. _(For example: `name` ot `title`. Property name of entity/dto.)_.
- `data-autocomplete-value-property`: * Identifier property name. _(For example: `id`)_.
- `data-autocomplete-items-property`: * Property name of collection in response object. _(For example: `items`)_
- `data-autocomplete-filter-param-name`: * Filter text property name. _(For example: `filter`)_.
- `data-autocomplete-selected-item-name`: Text to display as selected item.
- `data-autocomplete-parent-selector`: jQuery selector expression for parent DOM. _(If it's in a modal, it's suggested to send modal selector as this parameter)_.

    ```html
    <select asp-for="Book.AuthorId" 
        class="auto-complete-select"
        data-autocomplete-api-url="/api/app/author"
        data-autocomplete-display-property="name"
        data-autocomplete-value-property="id"
        data-autocomplete-items-property="items"
        data-autocomplete-filter-param-name="filter">

        <!-- You can define selected option(s) here  -->
        <option value="@SelectedAuthor.Id">@SelectedAuthor.Name</option>
    </select>
    ```

You can define selected option(s) inside select tags. AutoComplete select may can't find selected item if pagination is applied.


### Multiple Choices
AutoComplete Select supports multiple choices. If select tag has `multiple` attribute, it'll allow to choose multiple options.

```html
<select asp-for="Book.TagIds" 
    class="auto-complete-select"
    multiple="multiple"
    data-autocomplete-api-url="/api/app/tags"
    data-autocomplete-display-property="name"
    data-autocomplete-value-property="id"
    data-autocomplete-items-property="items"
    data-autocomplete-filter-param-name="filter">
    @foreach(var tag in SelectedTags)
    {
        <option value="@tag.Id">@tag.Name</option>
    }
</select>
```

It'll be automatically binded to an collection of defined value type.
```csharp
    public List<Guid> TagIds { get; set; }
```

## Possible Issues

### Permission Restriction
If the authenticated user doesn't have permission on given url, user will get an authorization error. Be careful while designing this kind of UIs.

You may place a lookup method in the same AppService, so your page can retrieve lookup daha of dependent entity without giving a entire read permission to users.
